# Stochastic-Volatility-Models



##### R Code to accompany 

####  _An Approach to Efficient Fitting of Univariate and Multivariate Stochastic Volatility Models_

**The preprint is available at:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08372) or  [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334457681_An_Approach_to_Efficient_Fitting_of_Univariate_and_Multivariate_Stochastic_Volatility_Models) 


* The data are in the folder *data* and are compressed R data files.
* The various PGAS files are in the folder *R* ... these are sourced in the files used to run the examples.
* Each example is identified by starting with `run_` and then a self describing title.  You just run the code, it will call the data file and PGAS procedure as needed.
* We changed the simulation a bit (Figures 1 & 2) but the preprint has the old figures - there's not much difference but we found a little blooper in the orignal version.


 _You'll need the following R packages to run all the code:_

* astsa
* plyr
* MASS 
* mcmc
